                        <p>Claire and I are easily distrated by new work. With the tendency to be attracted to what's newest, it's easy to question whether we'll ever be content or satisfied. To make matters more complicated, we both came upon our occupations as hobbies. The line between work and pleasure has become rather thin. The thinner it gets, the more work has by necessety become a matter of passion.</p>
                        <p>So, here we are. Passion is what I call the line between work and pleasure. But, think of it not as a divider, but as a combiner.</p>
                        <p>In my mind, it's the only reason I feel a semplence of satisfaction at the end of the day. If passion has done its job, work and pleasure/hobbies worked hand in hand. It's how I feel rest and peace when I lay my head down at night</p>
                        <p>To be honest, it's a rare day that work lines up with personal projects or hobbies. But should it always be that way?</p>
                        <p>This project, Passionately, is about exploring the depth of what's behind great art. Can great art only be made by artists who are willing to step outside of what makes them happy? Must great artists feel lack of satisfaction in order to acheive success? Is the melenial dream of pleasure making money only a dream?</p>
                        <p>We're going to interview as many artists as time and money will allow between April and August of 2013 to try to find some answers.</p>
